# in the following script, make number of nodes=1 and workers small. You can reduce batch size
# I had also an issue with the path, so I used the absolute path for each file in the train.txt and val.txt files.

# I had also the following error:
" AttributeError: module 'av' has no attribute 'from_image'"
and I fixed it by replacing av.from_image(..) by:
                container = av.open(frame)
                # Read the first frame from the container
                frames.append(next(container.decode(video=0)))
